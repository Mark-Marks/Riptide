# Riptide

A single-script architecture framework, designed with speed, ease of development and no bloat in mind.

## Features

### ⚡ Blazingly Fast

Riptide was designed with speed in mind. It creates little to no overhead over using your own or other loaders, and utilizes Red under the hood to achieve blazingly fast networking.

### 🔐 Type Safe

Riptide is fully strictly typed, giving full intellisense and improving the speed of development.

### 📦 Bloatless

Riptide is made to have as little bloat as possible, exposing and using only what's necessary.
